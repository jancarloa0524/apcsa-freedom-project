# Entry 1: The !(Final) Decision
##### 11/10/22

### My Decision

While I have decided on what tool I will use and the project I will create, I think it might be ambiitous, so it might not be my final decision, but I will purusue completing this project nonethless. 

I have decided on [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), a library used to process images sent to a computer, mainly in real-time. This works perfectly with my project idea, which is to create a program that will recognize a kick/block/punch/etc being thrown. From there, it could even learn to recognize sequences of kicks and punches, in order to show combinations.

I did not consider much else, becuase I already had a little bit of experience working with OpenCV in the past. I did find courses that I could use to learn OpenCV ([Link 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/hands-on-machine-learning-with-opencv-4/)[Link 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/computer-vision-and-machine-learning-with-opencv-4/)), as well as a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBQ4c1IQJSE) video that could help me learn Python.
### EDP
I am currently at stage 2 of the **Engineering Design Process**, since I have identified the project I want to work on, and have to commit to researching it. 
### Skills
One skill I feel I have worked on is my **creativity**, because I didn't just come up with the idea I have here, but many others. Some other ideas I had were: 
- A program that basically holds virtual demonstrations of Taekwondo technniques, which is super interactive with users.
- A TKD instructor reference database using Firebase, so that instructors can easily plan out classes and view a wide array of exercises/games they can use.
- A sleep debt tracking app, something simple I thought of after realizing it was hard to keep track of my sleep debt. An existing app I found was also a paid service, so I thought I could bring a free tool.
- A gratefullness app, just something that would make my own life a little easier, but could also be used by many others.

Another skill I feel I have worked on is **How to Google**, since I needed to figure out what resources I could use to learn OpenCV and all the things I need for it.
