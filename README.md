# APCSA Freedom Project: Computer Vision Deep Learning for Martial Arts
by Jan Carlo Avendano

## Context
The *Freedom Project* for APCSA is all about creating anything that we want, that must accomplish some sort of goal. We were given **complete freedom** in what we can do and use for this year of SEP, as we have spent the past few years learning all about computer programming and building applications. 

The **purpose** of this blog is to document the journey I took in learning everything I learned in order to end up with my final product, a Computer Vision Deep Learning Model that can recognize martial arts techniques, and be used to develop a suite of tools for martial arts training.

## Content
For my project, I am making a Computer Vision Program that uses a Deep Learning Model trained to recognize martial arts techniques in order to provide training tools for martial artists. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying several development tools in order to make both the model, and the tools.

## Implications
There are many things to consider when it comes to anything AI related, and so my project is no different.

It is easy to see the **positive** global effects this project can have, as it is: 
- Useful in providing martial arts training and instruction to anyone around the world. 
- Usable in analysis of martial arts technique
- Can be used as a fun way to train martial arts while improving technique

However, the potential **negative** effects of my project do exist economically:
- Part of martial arts instruction can be entirely replaced by this technology, specifically developing technique.
- People may feel that they can neglect having to train at a martial arts school in general, especially the more advanced the models/tools get.
